# Wingin-it

Anyone who knows me well, they know my passion for Motorsport, specifically for Formula One. The new rules introduced by the FIA in 2022, placed a major emphasis on the aerodynamics of the vehicles that capture our imagination on track. Enter the front wing. The front wing is critical to the managing the “dirty”, turbulent air that causes issues for trailing race cars (unless you were Max Verstappen in 2023). 

The avid F1 fandom caused me to cave and I decided to purchase a replica front wing. A quick google search led me to find this Red Bull replica front wing from F1Authentics. You may notice this particular replica front wing is $37 800 USD… which is almost $50 000 CAD. You may also notice upon checking my LinkedIn that I work and am clearly not rich. That’s when it hit me. Why purchase a replica formula one front wing when I can put on my engineering hat (hard hat?) and make one!

Welcome to Project Wingin’ IT.

The outline of this project is simple: 
- Create a mock sketch of a current Formula One Front Wing
- Model is using Fusion360 (although I am competent with Solidworks I found in my preliminary research that Fusion360 works well for 3D printing). For my first time I wanted to ensure that no gaps were present and my aerodynamic profiles were thick enough to print well.
- Collaborate with a local 3D printing shop to print my model in pieces
- Assemble my 3D printed model
- Sand, prime, and paint the 3D front wing
- Use stickers to mimic the sponsorships on the front wing

It sounds super simple when put like this right?

Using the red bull replica on the F1Authentics store I determined the front wing dimensions should be: 1400mmD X 2100mmW x 390mmH

I decided to scale these dimensions down to 65% scale to manage help the sheer size of the wing and to reduce costs when it comes time for the aesthetics (paint, stickers, etc).

This means our dimensions for this project will be: 910mmD X 1365 mmW X 253.50mmH 

Think of it as a wind tunnel model!

With our size determined the next step was to learn sketch how I would “separate” the 3D model and integrate these pieces later using super glue. The initial sketches can be found here. I am not Adrian Newey… as I’m sure those sketches indicate to you. A clear design decision I made at this juncture was to mimic the 2024 Ferrari front wing. As a proud Shell Employee this was an imperative step to display our Pectin (I like my job plz don’t fire me Shell).
