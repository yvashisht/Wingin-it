# Wingin-it

Anyone who knows me well knows my passion for Motorsport, specifically for Formula One. The new rule introduced in 2022, placed a major emphasis on the aerodynamics of the vehicles that capture our imagination while racing. Enter the front wing. The front wing is critical to the managing the “dirty”, turbulent air that causes issues for trailing race cars (unless you were Max Verstappen in 2023). 

The avid F1 fandom caused me to cave and I decided to purchase a replica front wing. A quick google search led me to find this Red Bull replica front wing from F1Authentics. You may notice this particular replica front wing is $37 800 USD… which is almost $50 000 CAD. You may also notice upon checking my LinkedIn that I work and am clearly not rich. That’s when it hit me. Why purchase a replica formula one front wing when I can put on my engineering hat and make one!
